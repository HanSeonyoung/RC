Bit Autonomous RC Car Project 
======================

Note: this repository was created for the final project of IoT embedded system developer course and won't receive any major updates. There are methods with better results than HoG for traffic sign detector, such as Deep Learning architectures. Still, you can use this repository as a study reference or for some practical purposes.

This is a traffic sign detector and classifier that uses dlib and its implementation of the Felzenszwalb's version of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG) detector.

The training examples used in this repository are from Korean road signs, but the classifier should work with any traffic signs, as long as you train it properly. Naver Map images can be used to train the detectors. 25~40 images are sufficient to train a good detector.

### Flow Chart

line detection
* Log into the TYPO3 back end
* Click on ''Admin Tools::Extension Manager'' in the left navigation
* Click the icon with the little plus sign left from the Aimeos list entry (looks like a lego brick)
* If a pop-up opens (only TYPO3 4.x) choose ''Make updates'' and "Close window" after the installation is done

**Caution:** Install the **RealURL extension before the Aimeos extension** to get nice looking URLs. Otherwise, RealURL doesn't rewrite the parameters even if you install RealURL afterwards!
